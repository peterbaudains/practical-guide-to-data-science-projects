# 1. Introduction

Publicly-funded data science research should be...

1. Reproducible
2. Open
3. Impactful

---
#### Reproducible
Anyone with access to your data and code (which should be as many people as possible) should be able to generate the same conclusions as you did. This strengthens confidence in your findings and is an essential part of the scientific process.

---
#### Open/Transparent
The legal and ethical requirements for data security notwithstanding, every effort should be made to ensure openness and transparency in how a particular result or finding has been produced. 

---
#### Impactful
The tagline to the Data Science Development Programme is

*"Data Science for Public Good"*

Data Science is increasingly being used to provide insights and make decisions in different domains. Every project on this year's programme has the ability have a meaningful impact.

The goal of this session is to introduce you to some of the technology that will be helpful in your projects. It's also to get you thinking about **how** you tackle your projects from a practical perspective.

The majority of the examples in this session are based from my experience using Python, however, I think most of the content is transferable to any language. 

Also, apologies to those for which the content in this session may seem obvious. Hopefully there will still be a few nuggets for you to take away. 

Feel free to ask me any questions as we go on.

# I'll start with an example...

```
jupyter lab
```

Q. How to approach this with reproducibility in mind?

Some tips: 

- Separate data from code
- Modularise and minimise your code 
- Version control your code
- Separate raw data from processed data
